# Synd.io Github Search Project

A simple app that returns the first 25 Github repositories found by user and/or stargazer count.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `yarn install`

## Setup

You will need a Github Personal Access Token. The Github GraphQL API requires this.

One you get your access token paste it where it says `<Access Token>` in `main.tsx` on line 22.

## Start

After the successfull installation of the packages: `yarn dev`

## Test

To run end to end tests: `yarn test`
